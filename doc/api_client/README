PREREQUIREMENTS

You must install ruby, use the following link http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/



WINDOWS

If you install the native Windows version of Ruby using the Ruby One-Click Installer, then the installer has setup Windows to automatically recognize your Ruby scripts as executables. Just type the name of the script to run it.

$ cd DIR/TO/EXECUTABLE/FOLDER/LOCATION
$ cmr_client.rb

If this does not work, or if you installed Ruby in some other way, follow these steps.
  1.- Log in as an administrator.
  2.- Run the standard Windows "Command Prompt", cmd.
  3.- At the command prompt (i.e. shell prompt), run the following Windows commands. When you run ftype, change the command-line arguments to correctly point to where you installed the ruby.exe executable on your computer.

    $ assoc .rb=RubyScript
    .rb=RubyScript

    $ ftype RubyScript="c:\ruby\bin\ruby.exe" "%1" %*
    RubyScript="c:\ruby\bin\ruby.exe" "%1" %*
